A web application built to estimate construction costs.

## Technologies Used

This project is built with:

*   **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript
*   **UI:** shadcn-ui, Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend :** Supabase

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <YOUR_GIT_REPOSITORY_URL>
    cd <PROJECT_DIRECTORY_NAME>
    ```
    *(Replace `<YOUR_GIT_REPOSITORY_URL>` and `<PROJECT_DIRECTORY_NAME>` with the actual URL and directory name)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
    *(Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/))*

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    *   If the project uses environment variables (e.g., for Supabase), create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary variables. Refer to `.env.example` if one exists.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, usually accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (check the terminal output for the exact URL).
